An application that visualises Philapelphia's public transportation data in real time, including on route buses, trolleys, trains and bus stops/train stations.
It's possible to select specific vehicles to access more data, for example destination, next stop, current stop, timing, free seats and more. 
As a basemap the application uses Mapbox tiles (https://www.mapbox.com/).
The data that is being processed and visualised is fetched from the SEPTA API service (http://www3.septa.org/api/).
For graphics, the application uses p5.js.

Application is deployed at: https://philadelphia-live-transit.herokuapp.com/
