An application that visualises Philapelphia's public transportation data in real time, including on route buses, trolleys, trains and bus stops/train stations.
It's possible to select specific vehicles to access more data, for example destination, next stop, current stop, timing, free seats and more. 
As a basemap the application uses Mapbox tiles (mapbox.com) and the server side part is built only to hide the api key, the functionality runs on client-side devices.
The data that is processed and visualised is being fetched from the SEPTA API service (www3.septa.org/api/).
For graphics the application uses p5.js.

Application is deployed at philadelphia-live-transit.herokuapp.com/
